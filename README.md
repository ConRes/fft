Fairly-fast fourier transformations in TypeScript, vanilla JavaScript, C++, WASM, maybe even MatLab.

## Motivation

Fourier transforms pose a variety of technical challenges which are fundamental to many image processing operations. This makes them an ideal start towards building primitives optimized for the web platform and that can be leveraged for other imaging operations.
